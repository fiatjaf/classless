classless
=========

**classless** is a standard for making blog-like themes that work on a more-or-less fixed HTML structure where classes are optional.

See https://classless.alhur.es/ for more information or just go to https://classless.alhur.es/themes to see the themes.

This has no relation with [marx, the classless CSS reset](https://github.com/mblode/marx) and we think it's a crime to defend, or even make CSS jokes with, a violent and inhumane ideology that has lead to the death, poverty, starvation, torture and rape of millions of people around the globe.
